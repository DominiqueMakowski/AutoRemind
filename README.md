# Automate Reminder Emails for Research Participants
**AutoRemind** is an email automation system for sending customizable reminders to participants at different timepoints throughout a study.
Running `autoremind.py` will mass send the desired mails to your participants together with printed feedback on how many subjects were contacted:
```
one day before: No session 1 participants to be contacted.
one day before: No session 2 participants to be contacted.
experiment day: 3 participants to be contacted for session 1.
experiment day: No session 2 participants to be contacted.
```
P.S. This package was borne out of a personal exasperating experience of manually emailing participants :smile:
Still a **Work in Progress** :octocat:
